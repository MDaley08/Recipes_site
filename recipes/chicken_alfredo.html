                <strong>Cook pasta</strong> bring a large pot of salted water to boil, then add fettuccine

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make chicken</strong> Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, 
                for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. 
                Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, 
                then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.

                <strong>Make the Alfredo sauce</strong> the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, 
                and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan 
                is added in until melted and smooth.
